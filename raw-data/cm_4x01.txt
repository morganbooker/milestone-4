Previously on criminal minds - where are we headed? - new york.
What do we know? All the killings are mid-day.
Single gunshot to the head with a .
22 Surveillance cameras have captured video of 3 of the murders.
They're all the same.
He wears a hood and keeps his head down.
Kate joyner heads up the new york field office.
She's running point on the case along with detectives brustin and cooper.
From the placement of that camera, Odds are the only view they're gonna get is the back of his head.
Let's not be too quick to decide what we do or don't have.
You mind telling me why i'm catching attitude from her? Fbi brass has made it clear to her that if she doesn't bring this case home, She's gonna be reassigned.
And you are at the top of the list to replace her.
Profile me.
You don't wear a ring.
And you were quick to flirt with me.
So you're happy to let people think you are a player.
But you love your wife, and you would never actually cheat on her.
Get out of the way! Garcia! We've got an officer down, We think we might have a serious problem.
We have multiple unsubs.
They're disciplined, they're using countersurveillance, They know the fbi movements, there's a hierarchy.
What does that usually equal? Terrorism.
They're ramping up to something, and they want us to know that they're watching us.
Creating panic ensures that they're see the most urgent response time short of a bombing.
We need to hit the ground running.
Hey, you ok? - sir, are you o-- - what's your name? What? - what's your name? - sam.
Call 911.
Yeah, yeah, i did.
Call 911, tell them there's been an explosion.
Sir, are you ok? You a cop? Listen, kate.
Don't worry.
We'll get 'em.
I know.
Call 911.
Tell them That a federal agent - ok, so you want me to say-- - kate! Kate! - 911, this is the guy that called about the explosion.
- kate! Kate! Kate? Kate? My purse! I can't find my purse.
- don't move.
- aaron, my purse.
I don't think you had one.
I must have dropped it.
Kate, kate, kate, stop trying to move.

No It doesn't hurt.
It doesn't hurt at all.
Kate, kate, we're gonna get you out of here, ok? We're gonna get you out of here.
They're coming, they're coming.
Officer down! Officer down! Here! Aaron.
They're not coming.
We told them not to, remember? Now, how does this work? The murders simulate a bombing.
They station someone to watch and gauge police response time.
At which point they know when to bring in a second bomb.
The goal is always to take out the first round of civilians, Followed by a second wave of emergency responders.
The first wave of responders are targets.
Proudly presents Season04 Episode01 Mayhem Never think that war, no matter how necessary nor how justified is not a crime.
Ernest hemingway.
You can't let go, can you, hotch? Aaron You don't have to stay.
I'm not leaving.
Officer down! We need some help! We cannot move! They're not coming.
Yes, your orders are not to let anyone in Until the area is cleared.
Oh, man.
- but that's-- - that's proper procedure.
We're getting reports that an explosion has rocked the neighborhood in the vicinity of the federal plaza.
Authorities have closed down the entire area And are not going to give any information at this time.
And with 8 suspicious incidences in as little as 3 weeks, We have no room but to speculate whether or not there will be more attacks.
We have no word yet on any injuries, But with the explosion heard as far away as prince street, An unconfirmed report said it was a car bomb.
Nypd's emergency services, as well as federal NYPD COMMAND CENTER David, i heard on the radio.
I tried the others, but-- The cell phone system is crashing.
- a car bomb.
Did they say where? - no.
Can you recall every site where the shootings occurred? Uh, hell's kitchen, murray hill, lower east side, chinatown.
All right, if our profile is correct and all We're looking at 8 suicide bombers who are about to hit every one of those locations.
Call homeland security.
Tell them to pour troops into all of those sites.
Actually, if we're correct, there'll be 16 suicide bombers.
Yeah, we predicted that they'll hit the second wave of emergency responders also.
Breaking news now.
We are just getting an update.
The bomb is now reported to have been inside an suv.
A black suv parked just blocks from 26 federal plaza.
Now, it is un CCTV COMMAND POST Agent rossi? We heard there was some kind of explosion.
- we got this.
- where are you? I just walked into the cctv command post.
Can you see anything? I literally just walked through the door, sir.
We got on the news it was an suv that exploded.
A black suv within blocks of the federal plaza.
- oh, god.
- now, do you have eyes there? I, uh--yeah, yeah, i've got like 300 cameras right there.
Give me a sec.
I'm here with reid, but i don't know where anyone else is.
- and, garcia - yes, sir.
- find them.
- ok.
Lisa, i need every feed of every camera for 20 blocks concentrically out from the federal plaza.
Get the best exposure from every angle you can - and then back those feeds up.
- you got it.
I'm gonna call the rest of my team.
Yeah.
I'm still here.
Yes, you are.
Thank god.
I'm almost back at the federal building.
What the hell's going on? All right, we're going over the closed circuit footage right now.
Who else have you checked on? You're the first.
Rossi and reid called me.
All right, well, keep me on the line while you check on everyone else.
Is everyone ok? I've spoken to rossi and reid and morgan's on the line.
Emily, where are you? I'm following detective brustin to one of the nypd's critical incident command posts.
One of them? Yeah, after They had way too many eggs in one basket on that day.
Has anyone talked to jj? She was headed back to the hotel.
- in an suv? - i think so.
Stay with me a minute.
I'll dial her mobile.
This is agent jareau, communications director for the fbi's behavioral-- What was that? What happened? It went dead mid-message.
Try here again.
She's probably back at-- Emily? Derek.
Derek? - i just lost all contact with my team.
- i found it.
I've never not been able to-- - garcia.
- what? I found the explosion.
F.

Field Office 26 FEDERAL PLAZA.
MANHATTAN Move to marshaling area echo.
There should be a team captain there.
Please report to your team captain and identify yourself.
Move to marshaling area echo.
- there should be a team captain there-- - shelly! Do you know what happened? Only that there was an explosion nearby.
We had to evacuate this building.
- they're anticipating a second wave.
- have you seen hotch or kate? No.
I was hoping you did.
Have you seen any of my team? Sorry, i All right, well me must be setting up a critical incident command center, right? in the tribeca district.
Ok.
You see any of my team, that's where i'll be.
Ok.
Move to marshaling area echo.
There should be a team captain there.
- oh, my god! - they weren't inside.
- they-- - weren't inside.
Right.
Play it again.
Right now.
Move this camera.
I have to see where they ended-- where--where they are now.
This isn't live, penelope.
Right.
Get me another angle.
We have to see what happened to hotch and kate.
Wait! - what are you doing? - we're going further back.
That explosion looked like it came from under the suv, not inside it, So i'm gonna guess that bomb wasn't there when it was parked.
That's him.
The bomber.
Uh, get me another angle, at timecode 12:06:06.
Got him.
He stopped.
Sam, you need to get out of the area.
I just want to help.
If you want to help, get somebody down here.
Kate, i need you to wake up.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
- i feel cold.
- what? It's such a cliche, isn't it? I feel cold.
Like in the cinema.
You've lost a lot of blood, but i think i've got it stopped.
Wait.
That's not right.
It's movies.
Um, you say movies, not cinema.
Just try to relax.
Why--why would you have a different word for All right, if they can't get down here, i'm gonna try to lift you and just-- - they just told me to get behind the barricade.
- ok, here, i'm gonna try to lift her.
All right, on 3.
1, 2, 3.
No, i lost it.
I lost my grip.
All right, i need to find it again.
Need to find it.
- kate, stay with me.
- she's bleeding.
She's bleeding! I think i've got it.
I think i got it.
She's not gonna die, is she? Kate, stay with us, please.
We're here! Please! Please! We're here! Someone! Who's in charge here? Captain warner.
- ok, ok, let's get this area cleared as soon as possible.
- captain warner-- We got people down there.
Captain warner, i'm agent morgan, fbi.
I'm looking for agent hotchner, aaron hotchner.
Go back to the federal building.
There are evac marshaling spots.
Check in to make sure they know where you are.
I am not about to do that.
Get out of my face or i'll have you bodily removed, agent.
Please, we're here! Hotch.
The area's restricted.
That's my boss down there.
My orders are what they are.
I don't give a damn what your orders are.
I get it, agent.
But we've been told by you responders are the targets.
So till the blast site is cleared, no one goes in.
You're marine corps, right? Right? Please, go back to the marshaling point.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not just gonna let my man lay down there like that.
Help us! Damn it, we're here! Never leave a man behind.
You do remember that, don't you? We're here! Please! Ok.
Hotch! Hotch! Fast-forward it.
He watched.
That son of a bitch watched.
Get me another timecode.
Oh, my god, that's the unsub.
And he's walking right up to hotch.
- hotch.
- morgan, we've got to get her out of here.
They're not letting any ambulances down here till they clear the scene.
Kid, you gotta get behind the barricades.
Let's go.
Go! - go, sam.
- good luck.
Talk to me.
Can we carry her? Hotch, can we carry her? No, i tried.
Morgan, she's gonna bleed to death if we don't get her out of here.
We gotta do something.
Please have service.
Please have service.
Please have service.
Please have service.
Garcia, i got hotch.
But listen to me.
You gotta get somebody down here right away, you hear me? Right now.
What? You're absolutely sure? Hotch.
The kid.
He's the bomber.
Go.
She's got an arterial bleed in her back and i'm doing my best to hold it closed.
You ok? I just want to get her out of here.
Her pulse is weak and thready.
- i'm gonna need your help, ok? - Ok.
Is the area clear? You were calling for help and i couldn't listen anymore.
My partner was too afraid to come in here with me.
Kate, we're gonna get you out of here.
We're on our way out of here.
These are stills from all the murder sites.
Garcia had us on conference and the system crashed.
Emily.
Oh, thank god you're all right.
where's will? He's stuck at the airport.
As soon as i heard, i went straight to 26 fed.
They're evacuating the building.
Where is everyone? Morgan's all right, but there's no word from hotch.
The bomber! The bomber! - what? - derek's chasing after him.
The bomb--it was in kate's suv or under it.
Hotch is out there with her.
He seems ok, but she looks really hurt.
He hasn't moved her.
Where was kate's suv parked? they target kate's suv? Have you i.
D.
Ed the bomber? Lisa's running him and dead guy through vicap.
Call homeland security.
They should be at all the murder sites.
- see if they found anything.
- i'm on it.
Garcia, find out how we can help morgan.
Yes, sir.
This is an emergency notification all train services are suspended until further notice.
Please remain calm and exit the station.
Out of my way! Move! Move! Where did he go? Where? This is an emergency notification.
All train services will be suspended until further notice.
Please remain calm and exit the station.
Show your face, you son of a bitch! I know you're in here, kid! Show me your face, you coward! You got nowhere to run, man.
You hear me? There's nothing down here for you? Is that all you see? Huh? Darkness? You listen to me, you son of a bitch.
You get your ass off those tracks and you put your hands on top of your head.
Do it now.
Do it now! - you will lose in the end.
- shut up.
Shut your mouth.
You want to know why? Because you fear what we embrace.
Get off the--no! No, no, no! - on 3--1, 2, Ok.
Ok, i'm gonna clamp that artery.
When i say move, move your hand and get as far out of my way as you can.
- you got it? - yep.
Ok, move.
Ok.
I need to get a bag in and start getting her pressure up.
Get the gurney from the bus.
Yes, yes, i understand.
Thank you.
Homeland security has poured tactical teams into all of those locations.
Uh, swat, bomb techs, hrt, hazmat, the works.
They found nothing.
Reid.
All except one.
Kate's suv-- none of the shootings were anywhere near it.
Maybe it's personal.
This death card they gave us-- they delivered on it.
That's just it-- they haven't.
With a cell as large as this one and multiple targets to choose from, They target a single suv? Where's the closest emergency room? - st.
barclay's.
- where? - st.
barclay's.
- and where is it? It's 4 blocks uptown, one block east.
Where's the emergency entrance? Under the hospital.
Just follow the signs to the e.
r.
Ok.
Hey, look who's back.
Hello.
Is she awake? Is that aaron? - are you aaron? - yeah.
- kate, we made it.
- thank you.
Don't thank me.
Thank your partner.
He did it all.
- what's this? - secret service.
We're directing all emergencies over to lenox hill.
I'm ssa hotchner.
I have ssa joyner on board.
She was injured in the bomb blast at federal plaza.
Credentials.
They're in my jacket at federal plaza.
I appreciate that, agent, but this hospital is on a strict bypass.
What is--what's that? It means the hospital is closed.
We're redirecting all emergencies to lenox hill.
She's not gonna make it to lenox hill.
I'm losing her! She's crashing! She's crashing! - please.
- i'm losing her.
Open it up.
His is delta 2.
I need immediate e.
r.
attendance.
What do you got? Bp 50 over 30, she's bradycardic with severe spinal injury.
Get her in the bag.
Get in the crash cart.
Let's get him on a gurney.
- Morgan's safe.
- good.
Thank god.
This is the unsub morgan chased into the subway.
This is the one prentiss shot.
Garcia's running them through vicap.
These are smart, well-educated kids, hand-picked and trained to be martyrs.
They're not gonna be in any government file and they won't have rap sheets.
Hotch and kate are at st.
Barclay's hospital.
How are they? Well, hotch is in the e.
r.
, kate's in surgery.
Morgan's on his way down there now.
The media's reporting this as a failed attack on 26 federal plaza.
Well, it's not.
They're not the only ones.
Homeland security feels the same way.
They're wrong.
They found nothing at any of the sites that you told them that these guys were targeting.
Maybe this thing is over.
Or maybe that's exactly what they want us to think.
As soon as the bomb techs identify the device, i want to know about it.
Of course.
Can you get in tighter on the bomber? Here, in his hand.
He's using his cell phone.
Joyner and hotch approach the van.
Why not wait until they both get in? Guess he figured he was close enough.
Wouldn't you wait until they were in it? - so far these guys have accomplished nothing.
- nothing? My partner was shot--cooper? Not to mention emily's suicide by cop.
Is that not enough? That was memorable.
This isn't.
Doc.
Fbi.
How's aaron hotchner? He's got acute acoustic trauma in his right ear, and i pulled shrapnel from his leg.
Just lay down.
Sir! Agent hotchner, lie down.
- doctor, i'm all right.
- hotch, stop it.
Just calm down.
- doc, i got it, ok? - morgan, where's kate? She's in surgery.
Where are my clothes, please? Hotch, your go bag is on its way.
Has anything happened since the first blast? Nothing.
- sam? - he's dead.
Morgan, the profile's wrong.
Everything--everything they've done so far has appeared to be something it's not.
I don't follow.
The seemingly random acts of murder, the attempt to hack into our security surveillance systems.
The suicide by cop to make us all believe that it was over.
Don't forget the death card telling us they know we're watching.
All diversions.
To ensure our attention and analysis of any given situation would than incorrectly inform our profile.
So the first responders were not the real target? - hotch and kate were a diversion, too? - from what? Morgan.
Hotch wants you guys over there now.
What do we tell homeland security? Tell them if they love this city as much as you do to keep it locked down.
It's about to get hit.
Are you ok? Yeah.
I just want to understand why i'm still alive.
I think the idea was to maim, not to kill.
Did you identify sam, the bomber? Garcia put sam and the other dead unsub into every know database.
Nothing.
We know how terror cells evolve.
They learn from one campaign to the next.
How to stay off radar like the london bombers.
Yeah, but they, uh, they hit at 8:50 in the morning With a series of coordinated blasts aimed at london's transportation system, And this cell targeted a lone suv where the only people on the street are 2 federal agents.
It's not multiple targets, it's one target.
One target, one bomb.
Garcia said the device was placed under kate's suv.
It was likely made using oxydizing agents, Including chromates,peroxides, perchlorates, chlorates, and red mercury, All jammed into a device no larger than a cell phone.
Imagine what a bomb the size of an oil drum could do.
Yeah, but to make something that big, you'd need a chemical engineer.
Like the recently deceased dr.
Azahari husin, asia's most-wanted bomb-maker? Authorities dubbed him the, uh, demolition man.
He treated each bomb like a work of art.
One wrong move He becomes a victim of his own creation.
He'll be more revered than all of the people who died as a result of his devices.
Stop the bomber, stop the bomb.
To do that, we need to know how they would deploy something that big.
Hotch.
- did you ever find sam's cell phone? - yes.
- did he call 911? - no.
He dialed one number 6 times every few minutes.
It was a disposable cell.
Garcia tracked the number, but it went dead minutes after sam died.
Whoever had it destroyed it.
Well, if he didn't have a secondary device to detonate, There's only one reason that he stayed with us.
To make sure the ambulance got to you.
And in a city on lockdown, an ambulance with its siren blaring and lights on, It's gonna make it through every roadblock virtually uncontested.
This hospital is on a strict bypass.
What is--what's that? It means the hospital is closed.
- and straight into a hospital with a bypass order on it.
- what? Secret service has a bypass on this hospital.
Secret service? Who are they protecting? That's who sam was calling, the paramedic on the ambulance.
The ambulance which i drove in here.
This hospital is their target.
Let's go.
Who you got in here? Why is that information important to you? The ambulance i drove in here-- where is it now? - in the basement.
Why? - there's a bomb in it.
- what? - it's rigged.
It's rigged to assassinate whoever it is you're protecting.
You need to get them and everyone else out of here right now.
We can't do that.
He's undergoing surgery as we speak.
The paramedic i came in with-- do you have eyes on him? That a cell in his hands? Garcia, can you remote access the cell phone grid i'm in and jam all the frequencies? Yeah, i can, but only for a short period of time.
There's a bomb in the basement of this building.
I'm on it.
Ok, we need to access and pinpoint the And then disrupt the satellite feeds to them and we need to do it fast.
Here we go.
Look, he's coming back.
He's gonna detonate the bomb manually if he has to.
Where did morgan go? He went to find the ambulance.
- alone? - let's head down.
Call air charlie one.
Move echo one to the roof as soon as he's out of surgery.
Air-vac him out of here.
The rest of us, we'll take the elevators.
Morgan? Yeah, baby.
- you sound stressed.
- do i? Where are you? Not where i want to be right now.
Garcia, take this down for me.
Fdny 108.
That's an ambulance.
So you ok? Yeah.
I'm fine.
Just track it for me.
- he's going to the basement.
- stairs.
Oh, my god.
Garcia, how long can you keep jamming the cell phone lines? Uh, a few minutes, max.
Why? 'Cause i'm gonna have to get this ambulance out of here.
Or you could just evacuate the building like everybody else.
No.
As soon as the airways are clear, this thing's going up.
Going up?Oh, my god, that's like 3 minutes, 'Cause that's when the satellite moves position.
Come on.
Garcia, listen to me.
I need you to find an area of town i can drive this thing, And you tell everybody, you hear me, everybody that i'm coming.
Come on, babe.
Do it! Go! All right, talk to me, garcia.
Ok.
Head north And floor it.
I'll tell you where to turn.
What was that? It was nothing.
Just talk to me! No! No! Nooo! Noooo! Prentiss.
How am i doing, garcia? How's he doing? One minute, 50 seconds.
Why does it always have to be you? Why do you always have to do this? NO SIGNAL Come on.
Come on! Derek, you don't have much time.
Please be smart about this.
Signal's coming back online.
Derek, drive to the opening and then get the hell out.
- there's something i really want you to know, garcia.
- 20 seconds.
Save it.
Just get out.
- no, no, no, i'm not quite there yet.
- 10 - morgan - just listen to me.
- 9 - morgan, please.
You know what you are, garcia? CALL CONNECTER - we just lost tracking.
- morgan! Derek? Fbi.
Put it down.
It's over.
Garcia I'll tell you what you are to me.
You're my god-given solace.
Woman, you promise me one thing Whatever happens Don't you ever stop talking to me.
I can't right now 'cause i'm mad at you.
I can wait.
What's happening? Where's the surgeon? We did all that we could.
I'm so sorry.
I'm telling you, we're gonna get caught.
Come on, kid, we're cops.
Smoking in a hospital is a federal offense.
You're on your own, kid.
I see the wife and kids came for a visit.
Have you told them you started smoking again? Give me a break.
I just got shot.
Now i'm standing in front of a beautiful woman in this ridiculous garb with a I.
V.
And a catheter connected to my Skididdibup.
Could've told me you were coming.
Yeah, i wasn't going to and i I thought i'd drop in - i'm on my way to the airport now.
- yeah.
Sorry to hear about agent joyner.
And hotchner-- is he ok? Uh, he can't fly for a little bit.
His ears are But he's gonna be fine.
Um, so--ok, i brought this for you.
For you and your family.
I'm told they are great seats.
You didn't have to.
I know.
I wanted to.
Could just as easily have been me.
Well I'm glad it wasn't.
Got a plane to catch, so Take care, cooper.
Mets tickets? Most people assume i'm a yankees fan.
I'm not most people.
Nope.
No, that girl is not.
Thanks.
Got it.
I'm your ride.
I thought agent davis was driving me.
She was.
I had her reassigned.
Don't you have something better to do? Than to annoy you for 3 hours? Hell, no.
- give me the keys.
- not a chance, hotch.
Let's go.
So did we ever find out who the secret service had in the hospital? Does it matter? No, i guess it doesn't.
Quantico's requested you transfer to run the new york office.
Hotch, they haven't even buried her yet.
We're at war.
Things change.
Don't i need your recommendation? You didn't give it, did you? Your actions, as incredibly brave as they were Would still be actions of an agent who doesn't truly trust anyone.
Hotch, i did it for this team.
My opinion doesn't matter.
Job's yours if you want it.
Hotch.
Your opinion matters to me.
My life matters to me, and i have and always will entrust you with it.
Would you do the same for me? Still want to drive?
